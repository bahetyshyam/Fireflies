"By Myself"

[Mike Shinoda:]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?

Do I sit here and try to stand it,
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness,
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?

Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself
(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I can't hold on
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(to anything watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Mike Shinoda:]
If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone

If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself
(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I can't hold on
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(to anything watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Mike Shinoda:]
How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid that I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
Don't you (know)
I can't tell you how to make it (go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (try)
I can't seem to convince myself (why)
I'm stuck on the outside

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I can't hold on
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(to anything watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

I can't hold on
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(to anything watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in
