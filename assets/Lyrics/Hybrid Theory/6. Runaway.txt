"Runaway"

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
Graffiti decorations
Under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learn were never true
Now I find myself in question
(They point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association
(You point the finger at me again)

[Chester Bennington:]
I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true
Now I find myself in question
(They point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association
(You point the finger at me again)

[Chester Bennington:]
I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I'm gonna run away and never say goodbye
(gonna run away, gonna run away, gonna run away, gonna run away)
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
(gonna run away, gonna run away, gonna run away, gonna run away)

I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
(gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind!
(gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind!
(gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind!
(gonna run away, gonna run away)

[Chester Bennington:]
I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I wanna run away
And open up my mind
I wanna run away
And open up my mind
I wanna run away
And open up my mind
I wanna run away
And open up my mind
